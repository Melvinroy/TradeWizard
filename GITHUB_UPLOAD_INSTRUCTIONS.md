# GitHub Upload Instructions for TradeWizard

Follow these steps to create a private GitHub repository and upload your TradeWizard project:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a Private Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `TradeWizard` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Professional Trading Journal Platform"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Select **Private** repository
5. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit all changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: TradeWizard Trading Journal Platform"

# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TradeWizard.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you want to install it)

### Install GitHub CLI (optional)
```bash
# Windows (using winget)
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

### Create and Push with GitHub CLI
```bash
# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create private repository
gh repo create TradeWizard --private --description "Professional Trading Journal Platform"

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: TradeWizard Trading Journal Platform"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Important Notes

1. **Keep it Private**: Make sure the repository is set to PRIVATE
2. **Sensitive Data**: The .gitignore file is configured to exclude:
   - Database files (*.db)
   - Environment variables (.env files)
   - Test files and screenshots
   - Claude settings
   - MCP servers

3. **After Upload**: You can add collaborators by going to:
   Settings → Manage access → Invite a collaborator

## Need Help?
